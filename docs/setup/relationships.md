THE PROBLEM

You've probably tried marketing before.

Hired an agency. Paid $3k-$10k a month.
Got some posts. Some impressions. Some "engagement."

But did you get more sales?

Most agencies get paid whether you grow or not.
They're incentivized to keep you paying—not to get you results.

We built something different.

HOW IT WORKS

01  SMALL COMMITMENT UPFRONT

    A foundation fee covers our baseline costs.
    Think of it as skin in the game—for both of us.

02  WE BUILD YOUR ENGINE

    Strategy. Production. Distribution. Management.
    Your entire content operation—handled.

03  YOU GROW, WE EARN

    Our real fee is tied to the growth we create.
    No growth = no performance fee. Simple.

Aligned incentives. Always.

WHO THIS IS FOR

This works if you:

✓  Have at least $10,000/month in revenue
✓  Sell something people actually want
✓  Are ready to invest in growth—not just "try marketing"
✓  Can handle more business if we send it
✓  Want a partner, not a vendor

This is NOT for you if:

✗  You're looking for the cheapest option
✗  You want to approve every post
✗  You're not ready to scale
✗  You just need "a video"
✗  You've burned through 5 agencies and blame all of them

We're selective because results take commitment—from both sides.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE INVESTMENT

Two components:

FOUNDATION FEE
──────────────
Annual commitment based on your business size.
Covers our baseline. Shows you're serious.
Typically 2-3% of your current revenue.

PERFORMANCE FEE
───────────────
Percentage of the growth we create.
Tiered based on how much you grow.
More growth = we both win bigger.

No retainers. No hourly billing.
Just results.

Every partnership is custom.
Book a call to get your specific numbers.

QUESTIONS

"What if I don't grow?"

You pay very little. The foundation fee covers our baseline,
but if we don't drive growth, we don't earn performance fees.
We're incentivized to make you money.


"How do you track growth?"

We integrate with your systems—POS, CRM, booking software,
whatever you use. Full transparency on both sides.


"What's the contract length?"

12 months. Real growth takes time.
This isn't a "try it for a month" thing.


"Why don't you just charge a flat fee?"

Because flat fees don't align incentives.
We want to win when you win. That's the whole point.


"How is this different from other agencies?"

Most agencies sell you hours or deliverables.
We sell you growth. Our pay depends on your results.


"What if I just need one project?"

That's fine—check out our Solutions page.
Partnerships are for businesses ready to go all-in on growth.
